# talks

Ever had the situation of speaking with someone and just as you're done talking, the next person you talk with results in the exact same conversation?

If enough people might be interested (with enough >= 1), it might make sense to just give some kind of talk. These can vary in size: from a handful of people to hundreds. In the end, you're transferring information.

Give more (interesting) talks! (yes, you're doing interesting stuff, you (might) just not know it yet).
