# 2021-labortageCTF

Due to playing CSAW-finals on the same weekend, I built the challenges and the infra giving them into the hands of a few people for them to host the event and be there for questions from the participants. Turns out: it worked really well!

The CTF wasn't big, there were like 15 challenges in total and about 15 people participated. In the end, I received great feedback, as a lot of people really liked it due to it being not as hard as many other CTFs these days which made it possible for some people without experience to participate.
