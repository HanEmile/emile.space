# 2020-labortageCTF

After learning that there would be no CTF for the labortage on the day before the event, I tried to create a minimal CTF from scratch. 

Although the platform and the challenges were as minimal as you could imagine, some people had a lot of fun with them and I know of one person who really got into playing CTFs through this.
