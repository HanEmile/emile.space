I'm currently "operating" a 26" [Specialized](https://www.specialized.com) [Stumpjumper Comp Carbon](https://www.specialized.com/de/de/stumpjumper-comp-carbon/p/23128?color=32920-23128&searchText=9103-4415).

It's retrofitted with a 1x11 Shimano XT M8000 drivetrain and a 110mm Fox Float front fork, a Hope Pro 4 back hub and a PNW Dropper.

It's a joy to ride and quite fun to maintain, at least in my opinion.

## log

2022-01-02: rear shifter cable broke at the rear shifter (second time, seems like something is rubbing and I'm shifting a lot, so I'm going to investigate this further)
