# relaunch thoughts

Well, I've "relaunched" [emile.space](https://emile.space) with the intention to keep it a bit more active in 2022 and for now I've got to say: I't working quite ok.

I've got everything set up so that creating new pages and updating existing pages is as easy as possible.

This includes building the local version using the build script and publishing the page combining the build and the sync script described in the [relaunch](/blog/2021/12-26-relaunch) post.

Stay tuned!
