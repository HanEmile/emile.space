# 0h gamejam 2019

A 0h gamejam can work only during the Daylight-Saving-Time period, in which the time is set back one hour, essentially "consuming" an entire hour. This allows doing stuff in negative time, which was used to create a game.

For this game, I started using golang, as I was kind of interested in it at the time. I completely mis-estimated how much I could do in one hour in a language I hadn't had any expreience in, so the end result is super minimal, but something that works (on all platforms!).

(I'll have to upload that game somewhere sometime... ...ping me if you read this after 2023 or so...)
