# Project

the project category contains all projects.

(I'm still in the process of listing all the projects here)

All projects should be "pona" (good, simple, friendly).

## general overview

I'll describe some projects here, this might be helpful to get an overview.

- [xilero](xilero) is a tiny tool to name projects (that might explain the weird names below)
- [yonilu](yonilu) is a [twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) client
- [vokobe](vokobe) is the tool building the [emile.space](/) site
- [mobesi](mobesi) is a "multiplayer" http proxy
- [miboma](miboma) was the initial python implementation of [vokobe](vokobe)
- [lun](lun) is the tiny ecosystem I'm currently trying to build from scratch
- [bodula](bodula) is the source code management system I'm in the process of building

The other projects are either self-explanitory or better described by just visiting their page
