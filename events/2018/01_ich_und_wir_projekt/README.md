# Ich und Wir Projekt

2018-01-17 - 2018-01-18

During the first weeks of school in 5th grade, the new students have a so called "ich und wir" (me and us) project in which they do all kinds of things: from activities to workshops. For four years, I organized a part of the medienscouts workshops.

We mostly went into password security, giving the students an understanding of how "secure" a password is, how this could be determined and what they should look out for.
