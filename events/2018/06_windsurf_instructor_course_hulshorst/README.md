# windsurf instructur course hulshorst

2018-06-02 - 2018-06-09

Did the course and would just have had to do a one month intership somewhere to "officially" become a VDWS licensed windsurf instructor, but with university and other things starting, I never got to do that (and actually I already did the internship the year before, but they didn't accept it because "I wasn't 18 and would have had to register the internship beforehand" which I still find kind of nonsense but whatever...)
