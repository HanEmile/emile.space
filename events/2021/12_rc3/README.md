The second remove "congress" replacement. Well, this one was weird imho. Like people put so much effort into all of this, but turned off the ability to communicate in the lobby, so there were at least 50-100 people standing there that could not be talked with as in the last year. Due to the maps being so large, you just got lost and rarely met other people which really doesn't do it for me.
