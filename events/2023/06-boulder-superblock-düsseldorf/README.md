# Boulder superblock d√ºsseldorf

After the boulder session with ryd at [easterhegg](/events/2023/04-easterhegg/) in Hamburg, I went to [superblock](https://www.superblock.nrw/) again (last time [2023-03-04](https://emile.space/events/2022/03-04_bouldern_superblock/)) with Floris.

The following is just for me in the future to track my progress, as I'd like to improve:

Superblock has multiple difficulty levels based on colors:

- green (easy)
- blue
- red
- white
- black (hard)

Green was no problem, blue was fun and red kind of impossible. I realized that I enjoyed the technical boulders while struggling on small holds and holds that require grip strenght (this is to be trained).
