# bsides indore ctf cccac

Played CTF in Aachen at [cccac](https://ccc.ac) with the [cccac](https://gist.github.com/HanEmile/d12e0ba39d1b86d58a78a8e88ea2c7b5) Team.

We got 2nd Place! First-Blooding and being the only team to solve the Lengan challenge. Liz and me were sitting there the most time, while liz hadn't wrote a rop-chain before, but was quite familliar with arm asm, this took some time (as the challenge binary uploaded by the organizers for us to exploit locally was the wrong one). There were a lot of things that didn't work out which resulted in an approximately 20 hour pursuit resulting in the flag which was super satisfying.
