# 03-geekend-berlin

Went to berlin with about 10 people from chaosdorf

went to a few hackspaces:

- cbase (party)
- xhain (soldering workshop with mitch altman and a few others)
- afra (hang around until we got the train back)

the journey back had 165 min. delay which is a new record for me at the time of writing!

- The [projects/glitchart](https://emile.space/projects/glitchart/) started here for me
