Reversing a binary is kind of essential for understanding what it does, assuming you don't have the source lying around.

We'll go through the existing tools (the "big" ones such as Ida, Ghidra, Hopper, Binary Ninjna, Radare2, ...) and other tools that can be helpful and get an understanding of how we can use them, or more imporant, what they offer us and when we want to use them.

(Might also introduce the qiling framework or so)
