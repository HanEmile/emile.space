# ctf (beginner)

@[chaosdorf](/projects/chaosdorf/)

A general overview of the CTF world for new people. The goal was to provide people who have never participated in CTFs a general overview of the world of CTFs and give them some place to start, ask questions, get some basic tips and overall an nice environment to play their first few challenges.

For this, I repurposed the labortage ctf infra keeping the challenges which had all been solved by then.

As the challenges were built to be easy, letting people who had never participated in CTFs play them was quite nice, as it wasn't all to hard to be demotivating, but enough to keep them interested.

This is the second workshop in the series, more information can be found [on the chaosdorf blogpost](https://chaosdorf.de/2021/10/veranstaltung-it-sicherheits-wettbewerbe-ctf/).
