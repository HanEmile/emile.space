# heap

[emile](/about#contact) [/ctf/resources/heap/](/ctf/resources/heap/)

This workshop will focus on the heap and build a foundation for the next workshop. The goal is to introduce all heap related items (cunks, arenas, fastbins, caches, ...) and go through some of the glibc-source in order to get an understanding of how the heap actually works.
