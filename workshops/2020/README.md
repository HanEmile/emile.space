# 2020

I didn't give any workshops 2020

I planned to hold the r2wars workshop, but as the pandemic hit and nobody really new what the status was, it just didn't happen (and I'd need to find people interested in such topics, which isn't easy, as people constantly underestimate themselves and overestimate the complexity of such topics).
